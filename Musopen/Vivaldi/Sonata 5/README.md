Antonio Vivaldi wrote a set of six sonatas for cello and continuo, written between 1720 and 1730, and published in Paris in 1740 by Leclerc and Boivin. These sonatas were published without an opus number; sometimes they are improperly called op. 14. In addition to this publication, Vivaldi wrote at least four other cello sonatas. The manuscripts of two of these are kept in the library of the conservatories of Naples, and another is kept in the castle of Wiesentheid. One sonata in D minor (RV 38) has been lost.
