Credits:

All parts performed by Jon Sayles - on either a Sakurai (1976) Classical Guitar, or a LoPrinzi concert classical guitar (which I bought on eBay!).   I used a Korg D1600. with two condensor microphones for recording the individual tracks.
All of the songs (except unfortunately Revecy) use stereo mic'ng - which adds to the overall audio (Thanks largely to my brother-in-law Bill Hudak (Hebron, CT) - a very accomplished recording engineer, song-writer and musician for that tip).
And some thanks to those who shaped my playing...

Thanks to...
My dad and mom (David and Joanne Sayles) for passing on their and their love of music - all styles.
Thanks to All my guitar instructors and music teachers along the way - for their infinite patience, and for how much they accomplished with such little raw musical-material (me).  Especially thanks to:
Richard Provost, Alan Spriestersbach and Joe Iadone (1914 - 2004), my teachers at the Hartt College of Music
Greg Bonnenberger and Sal Salvador, my teachers at the University of Bridgeport
Andrew Lundquist (died 2007) - my high school choral instructor - who inspired me to tackle music as a career, and who gave his gift of music to thousands of fortunate kids throughout his illustrious career as a singer, choral director and teacher.
Susan Iadone, who (along with Joe Iadone) taught me pretty much everything I know about Early Music - and who transcribed almost all of the pieces I've recorded.
Christopher Sayles - my son, who acted as sound engineer on this endeavor, and who is the best bass player I've ever had the pleasure of performing with.
Graeme Irwin and family - Friends of Early and Renaissance music, discerning critics, and simply among the nicest folks on the planet.
Most of all, thanks to Maryellen Sayles - my wife, the love of my life and bride of 33++ years.  This is for you honey.  I hope all the time I've spent practicing, recording, publishing, etc. (time not spent in your lovely company) is somehow worth it.
