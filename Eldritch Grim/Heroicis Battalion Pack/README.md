Mega pack of 7 short trailer essentials/tracks pack. I created these a while ago and didn't know what to do with them, so here they are. I revised them a bit and tweaked the sounds with 3D effect visulization (headphones only) for 3 tracks. I've also included 1 track with 8D audio (headphones only).

 

Listed in order of the preview file:

 

Workout with Ninja
Imperial Gargantium
Forgot to Unplug the Mech
Door of Fury
The Seige Tower is Here
Tell Him War
Ritual To the Tikis (8D)
 

I have to admit that some of these tracks do need some improving so please show some support and favorite this post, it does mean a lot. Some files only have mp3 filetype.

 

Please enjoy!
