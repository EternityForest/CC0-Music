Hello everyone! I hope summer has treated you well! To bring in the new season, I'm bringin' in a new song! Courtesy of my Ko-Fi supporters. I had the option to either go spooky here or cozy, and I was feelin' cozy. I hope you enjoy!

This song (and everything else I make) is royalty-free! If you like the work I do and would like to help support me in making more free music, please consider supporting me on Ko-Fi. Making super fun music is my passion and my dream is to do it forever!!! I appreciate you all and hope you have a wonderful day.

 

All the best!

 

Zane

This track was made for my demo reel/menu sorta thing. I had considered calling it "hire me" but I have other plans for that one. Anyways, enjoy this musical journey through all sorts of wacky digital dimensions! It was a total blast to make. It's also free to use however you'd like!

 

I am open for commissions though so hit me up. The economy's rough right now :,0

I made this song to celebrate 100 music uploads on Newgrounds, but it's also completely copyright free, so enjoy!

An upbeat and heroic track for HEROES ONLY. If you are not a hero, do not listen to this music. You will explode.

This song was for a research paper that someone is working on. It's very cool and I'm excited to share about it when it's ready! 3D animators and musicians familiar with Animusic will rejoice!
